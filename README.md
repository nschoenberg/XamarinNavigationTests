# XamarinNavigationTests

Testing out more complex navigation with xamarin to verify correct behaviour on different platforms.
Microsoft recommends to use Master Detail only as Main Page. This project helps to check what happens when someone violates this rule.

It is also interesting to see that each platform handles it in its own way, UWP is by far the weakest.

Content Page => Content Page => Master Detail (3 Details) => TabbedPage (3 Childs)
